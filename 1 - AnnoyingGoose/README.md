# 1 - Annoying Goose

## About

This script is based around the Desktop Goose tool made by samperson.
Check that out first here: https://samperson.itch.io/desktop-goose

This script downloads a (slightly stripped) version of the program I uploaded online.
One downloaded, it then runs the program.

After a few iterations, I eventually settled on this version. Previous versions ran the download and .zip extraction line by line, requiring the Malduino to be plugged in for the entire time, until the Desktop Goose began to run. Instead, this script writes a Powershell script (.ps1) that does this for you, and then runs said script. This means the Malduino can be unplugged substantially earlier, making it much better for a quick drop off.

I am unlikly to make any more changes soon, but have the idea to allow the duck to be controlled by a mobile phone. This however is beyond the bredth of a "Malduino" script and may not even happen at all.

## Usage

To use this script, clone the repo or download the Download Me.zip, in which both the lite and elite version of the script can be found

## Notes

NOTE: There are some slight changes (mainly in timing) to the Lite script, as this is the one I test and use. The elite script is the one generated by the script converter, whereas the Lite is slightly edited in the Arduino IDE.
